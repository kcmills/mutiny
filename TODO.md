## TODO

### Soon

* Documentation for other maintainers
* Reorganise lib, having in mind a "mutiny-core" which is separate to specific integrations (RSpec, etc), specific mutators (Metamorpher-based, etc), specific reporters (command-line, HTML, etc), etc. Consider hexagonal architecture.


### Later

* Profiling to determine bottlenecks
* [Incrementality](design/incrementality.md)
